TemplateSim
===========

*A small, simple, flexible, Pythonic template system for scientific simulations*

Overview
--------

TemplateSim is currently in the absolute alpha stage, but I hope that it will eventually become a useful tool for anyone who has to run lots of simulations with many configuration options and keep track of which simulations had which options.

This is currently just a port of files I have used for a research project that involved Matlab modeling of HIV. It has not been adapted at all for other people or other projects, but I expect that to happen very soon. Putting it on GitHub will hopefully provide some impetus to that.

Documentation
-------------

The command line options document themselves, and the configuration files use the Python config file syntax.

Currently, if you want low-level details, you'll have to look through the source. It should be relatively well-commented. Better documentation will come.

A note about this: normally, I'm not so fanatical about licensing, etc. but I really believe in keeping something small like this really free. I don't want it getting big or out of hand.
